GovHack Trample Project

Melbourne is one of the world's most sprawling cities. We have an extensive public transport network of trams, trains and buses, yet most Melbournians rely on driving to get around the city. We wanted to find out which areas in Melbourne have the poorest access to public transport. 

We developed a set of database queries which allowed us to manipulate and merge Public Transport Victoria data with Australian Bureau of Statistics data to product a complete map of the Melbourne Metro area

As none of the members of this group have had any previous BigData experience, for us producing a full map with multiple datasets was a huge achievement. We all learnt a lot about the tools and techniques that are available, including PostGRES and PostGIS, Quantum GIS and TileMill for producing tidy maps.
